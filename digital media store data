here is some SQL that i wrote for a digital media store.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
select firstname, lastname, customerid, country 
from chinook.customers
where country != 'USA';

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
select * 
from chinook.customers
where country= 'Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
from chinook.invoices as inv 
left join chinook.customers as cust 
on inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
where inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
select * from chinook.employees
where title like '%sales% agent%';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
select distinct BillingCountry 
from chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
select emp.firstname, emp.lastname, inv.invoiceid
from chinook.employees as emp
join chinook.customers as cust
on cust.supportrepid= emp.employeeid
join chinook.invoices as inv
on inv.customerid= cust.customerid;


#7.
