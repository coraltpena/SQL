In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
select count(orderid)
from bit_db.JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
select count(orderid)
from bit_db.JanSales
where product= 'iphone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
select acctnum
from bit_db.customers cust
inner join  bit_db.FebSales feb
on cust.order_id= feb.orderid;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT product, min(price)
from bit_db.JanSales;

or

SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE  price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);


#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
select sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product 
from bit_db.JanSales
GROUP BY product;


#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select product, quantity, sum(price)
from BIT_DB.febsales
where location= '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
group by product;


#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
select 
count(cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2;

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
select product,sum (quantity)
from bit_db.febsales
where location like '%los angeles%:'
group by product;
